# what is BYR

Picture this: A frustrated developer tired of wrestling with complicated resume tools, then struggling with the format choice and its acceptace. then ATS is a whole other discussion. I wanted to create a tool that's as easy as a walk in the park, to create good looking latex base resume templates.
with the help of BYR, you can create a resume in most effective way and also in most ATS friendly way.
